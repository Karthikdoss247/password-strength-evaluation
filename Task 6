Comparison Table

Password	Length	Complexity	Strength

P1	18	High	Strong
P2	17	Very High	Very Strong
P3	11	Low	Weak
P4	11	Medium	Moderate



---

Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack

Attempts all possible combinations

Longer and complex passwords significantly increase attack time


Dictionary Attack

Uses common words and known passwords

Passwords containing dictionary words are highly vulnerable



---

Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use passwords longer than 12 characters

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid dictionary words, names, and patterns

Do not reuse passwords across platforms

Use a password manager for secure storage



---

Conclusion

Password complexity plays a critical role in cybersecurity. Passwords P1 and P2 demonstrate strong resistance to common attacks due to their length and character diversity. Passwords P3 and P4 are weaker due to predictable words and patterns and should be avoided for sensitive systems.
